A personal static site generator, written in Go.

A simple tool for a simple task: Build a static site of HTML files and assets out of my blog posts, which are Markdown files. This is a learning project for me and my new pal, Golang.

I expect this project to evolve over time, as I periodically realize new functionality I'd like the program to have.
